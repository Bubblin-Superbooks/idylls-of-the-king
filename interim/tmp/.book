  "page-49": "<pre class=\"no-indent  \">I?'\n\nAnd Gareth went, and hovering round her chair\nAsked, 'Mother, though ye count me still the child,\nSweet mother, do ye love the child?'

'Yea, my well-beloved,\nAn 'twere but of the goose and golden eggs.'\n\nAnd Gareth answered her with kindling eyes,\n'Nay, nay, good mother, but this egg of mine\nWas finer gold than any goose can lay;\nFor this an Eagle, a royal Eagle, laid\nAlmost beyond eye-reach, on such a palm\nAs glitters gilded in thy Book of Hours.\nAnd there was ever haunting round the</pre>",
  "page-50": "<pre class=\"no-indent  \">palm\nA lusty youth, but poor, who often saw\nThe splendour sparkling from aloft, and thought\n\"An I could climb and lay my hand upon it,\nThen were I wealthier than a leash of kings.\"\nBut ever when he reached a hand to climb,\nOne, that had loved him from his childhood, caught\nAnd stayed him, \"Climb not lest thou break thy neck,\nI charge thee by my love,\" and so the boy,\nSweet mother, neither clomb, nor brake his neck,\nBut brake his very heart in pining for it,\nAnd past away.'\n\nTo whom the mother said,\n'True love, sweet son, had risked himself and climbed,\nAnd handed down the golden treasure to him.'\n\nAnd Gareth answered her with kindling</pre>",
  "page-51": "<pre class=\"no-indent  \">eyes,\n'Gold?' said I gold?—ay then, why he, or she,\nOr whosoe'er it was, or half the world\nHad ventured—had the thing I spake of been\nMere gold—but this was all of that true steel,\nWhereof they forged the brand Excalibur,\nAnd lightnings played about it in the storm,\nAnd all the little fowl were flurried at it,\nAnd there were cries and clashings in the nest,\nThat sent him from his senses:  let me go.'\n\nThen Bellicent bemoaned herself and said,\n'Hast thou no pity upon my loneliness?\nLo, where thy father Lot beside the hearth\nLies like a log, and all but smouldered out!\nFor ever since when traitor to the King\nHe fought against him in the Barons' war,\nAnd Arthur gave him back his</pre>",
