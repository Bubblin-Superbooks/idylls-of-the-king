There in the holy house at Almesbury
Weeping, none with her save a little maid,
A novice:  one low light betwixt them burned

Beneath a moon unseen albeit at full,
The white mist, like a face-cloth to the face,
Clung to the dead earth, and the land was still.

Ready to spring, waiting a chance:  for this

With silent smiles of slow disparagement;
And tampered with the Lords of the White</pre></div> </div>
