Sent, that he bore the prize and could not find
The victor, but had ridden a random round
To seek him, and had wearied of the search.

And ride no more at random, noble Prince!

This will he send or come for:  furthermore
Our son is with him; we shall hear anon,
Needs must hear.'  To this the courteous Prince
Accorded with his wonted courtesy,
Courtesy with a touch of traitor in it,
And stayed; and cast his eyes on fair Elaine:
Where could be found face daintier? then her shape
From forehead down to foot, perfect—again
From foot to forehead exquisitely turned:
'Well—if I bide, lo! this wild flower for me!'
And oft they met among the garden</pre></div> </div>
