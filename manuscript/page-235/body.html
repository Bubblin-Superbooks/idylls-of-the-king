Till my dear lord arise and bid me do it,
And drink with me; and if he rise no more,
I will not look at wine until I die.'

At this he turned all red and paced his hall,
Now gnawed his under, now his upper lip,
And coming up close to her, said at last:
'Girl, for I see ye scorn my courtesies,
Take warning:  yonder man is surely dead;
And I compel all creatures to my will.
Not eat nor drink?  And wherefore wail for one,
Who put your beauty to this flout and scorn
By dressing it in rags?  Amazed am I,
Beholding how ye butt against my wish,
That I forbear you thus:  cross me no more.
At least put off to please me this poor gown,
This silken rag, this beggar-woman's</pre></div> </div>
