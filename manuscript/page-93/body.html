<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">again,
For an your fire be low ye kindle mine!
Will there be dawn in West and eve in East?
Begone!—my knave!—belike and like enow
Some old head-blow not heeded in his youth
So shook his wits they wander in his prime—
Crazed!  How the villain lifted up his voice,
Nor shamed to bawl himself a kitchen-knave.
Tut:  he was tame and meek enow with me,
Till peacocked up with Lancelot's noticing.
Well—I will after my loud knave, and learn
Whether he know me for his master yet.
Out of the smoke he came, and so my lance
Hold, by God's grace, he shall into the mire—
Thence, if the King awaken from his craze,
Into the smoke again.'
