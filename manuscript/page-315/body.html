And therefore be as great as ye are named,
Not muffled round with selfish reticence.
How hard you look and how denyingly!
O, if you think this wickedness in me,
That I should prove it on you unawares,
That makes me passing wrathful; then our bond
Had best be loosed for ever:  but think or not,
By Heaven that hears I tell you the clean truth,
As clean as blood of babes, as white as milk:
O Merlin, may this earth, if ever I,
If these unwitty wandering wits of mine,
Even in the jumbled rubbish of a dream,
Have tript on such conjectural treacheryâ€”
May this hard earth cleave to the Nadir hell
Down, down, and close again, and nip me flat,
If I be such a traitress.  Yield my boon,
Till which I scarce can yield you all I</pre></div> </div>
