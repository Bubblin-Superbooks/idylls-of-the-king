I bid the stranger welcome.  Thanks at last!
But yesterday you never opened lip,
Except indeed to drink:  no cup had we:
In mine own lady palms I culled the spring
That gathered trickling dropwise from the cleft,
And made a pretty cup of both my hands
And offered you it kneeling:  then you drank
And knew no more, nor gave me one poor word;
O no more thanks than might a goat have given
With no more sign of reverence than a beard.
And when we halted at that other well,
And I was faint to swooning, and you lay

And yet no thanks:  and all through this wild wood
And all this morning when I fondled</pre></div> </div>
