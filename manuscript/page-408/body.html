Then rose Elaine and glided through the fields,
And past beneath the weirdly-sculptured gates
Far up the dim rich city to her kin;
There bode the night:  but woke with dawn, and past

Sweetly forbore him ever, being to him
Meeker than any child to a rough nurse,
Milder than any mother to a sick</pre></div> </div>
