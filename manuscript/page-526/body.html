From prime to vespers will I chant thy praise
As prowest knight and truest lover, more

To have thee back in lusty life again,
Not to be bound, save by white bonds and warm,
Dearer than freedom.  Wherefore now thy horse
And armour:  let me go:  be comforted:
Give me three days to melt her fancy, and hope
The third night hence will bring thee news of gold.'
