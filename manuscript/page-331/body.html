<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">King
Pronounced a dismal sentence, meaning by it
To keep the list low and pretenders back,
Or like a king, not to be trifled withâ€”
Their heads should moulder on the city gates.
And many tried and failed, because the charm
Of nature in her overbore their own:
And many a wizard brow bleached on the walls:
And many weeks a troop of carrion crows
Hung like a cloud above the gateway towers.'

And Vivien breaking in upon him, said:
'I sit and gather honey; yet, methinks,
Thy tongue has tript a little:  ask thyself.
The lady never made unwilling war
With those fine eyes:  she had her pleasure in it,
And made her good man jealous with good cause.
And lived there neither dame nor damsel</pre></div> </div>
