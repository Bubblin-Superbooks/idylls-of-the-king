And left me gazing at a barren board,
And a lean Order—scarce returned a tithe—
And out of those to whom the vision came

And now his chair desires him here in vain,
However they may crown him otherwhere.

That which he rules, and is but as the hind
To whom a space of land is given to plow.
Who may not wander from the allotted</pre></div> </div>
