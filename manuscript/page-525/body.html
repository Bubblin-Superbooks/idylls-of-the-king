Marred though it be with spite and mockery now,
Other than when I found her in the woods;
And though she hath me bounden but in spite,
And all to flout me, when they bring me in,
Let me be bounden, I shall see her face;
Else must I die through mine unhappiness.'

And Gawain answered kindly though in scorn,
'Why, let my lady bind me if she will,
And let my lady beat me if she will:
But an she send her delegate to thrall
These fighting hands of mineâ€”Christ kill me then
But I will slice him handless by the wrist,
And let my lady sear the stump for him,
Howl as he may.  But hold me for your friend:
Come, ye know nothing:  here I pledge my troth,
Yea, by the honour of the Table</pre></div> </div>
