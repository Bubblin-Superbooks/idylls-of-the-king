His age hath slowly droopt, and now lies there
A yet-warm corpse, and yet unburiable,
No more; nor sees, nor hears, nor speaks, nor knows.
And both thy brethren are in Arthur's hall,
Albeit neither loved with that full love
I feel for thee, nor worthy such a love:
Stay therefore thou; red berries charm the bird,
And thee, mine innocent, the jousts, the wars,
Who never knewest finger-ache, nor pang
Of wrenched or broken limbâ€”an often chance
In those brain-stunning shocks, and tourney-falls,
Frights to my heart; but stay:  follow the deer
By these tall firs and our fast-falling burns;
So make thy manhood mightier day by day;
Sweet is the chase:  and I will seek thee out
Some comfortable bride and fair, to grace
Thy climbing life, and cherish my prone</pre></div> </div>
