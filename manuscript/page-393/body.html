But little cause for laughter:  his own kin—
Ill news, my Queen, for all who love him, this!—
His kith and kin, not knowing, set upon him;
So that he went sore wounded from the field:
Yet good news too:  for goodly hopes are mine

A sleeve of scarlet, broidered with great pearls,
Some gentle maiden's gift.'

Past to her chamber, and there flung herself
Down on the great King's couch, and writhed upon it,
And clenched her fingers till they bit the palm,
And shrieked out 'Traitor' to the unhearing</pre></div> </div>
