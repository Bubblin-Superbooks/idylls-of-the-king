Saving the goodly sword, his prize, and took
Gawain's, and said, 'Betray me not, but helpâ€”
Art thou not he whom men call light-of-love?'

'Ay,' said Gawain, 'for women be so light.'
Then bounded forward to the castle walls,
And raised a bugle hanging from his neck,
And winded it, and that so musically
That all the old echoes hidden in the wall
Rang out like hollow woods at hunting-tide.

Up ran a score of damsels to the tower;
'Avaunt,' they cried, 'our lady loves thee not.'

And I have slain this Pelleas whom ye hate:
Behold his horse and armour.  Open</pre></div> </div>
